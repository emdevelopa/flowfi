# GitHub Discussions Guide

Welcome to FlowFi's GitHub Discussions! This is the place for community conversations, questions, and ideas.

## Overview

[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/flowfi/flowfi/discussions) is our community forum for topics that don't fit neatly into Issues. We use it to keep Issues focused on actionable work while providing a space for broader conversations.
